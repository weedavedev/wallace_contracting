# Now for some page routing and images

This is getting more like it, well what the plan is anyway. I have a client who has a very simple website, just showcasing some work projects. I am thinking this is a good chance to try out multiple pages, headers with nav bars, a gallery with enjoyable animations also we will throw in a contact form, the prevous two more simple sites would benifit from completing that task. 
## Technical-ish stuff

The framework is SvelteKit again, locally developed in Webstorm, built using vite and Tailwind CSS.
Github is doing the hosting through the pages feature and I have my domains DNS nameservers settings pointing here.


### Todo

- Initial Branch (Main)
    * create basic page layouts 
      * nav bar, footers, main
    * handle routing between pages
    * work with flex box for a consistant site wide style
    * try out svelte and some gallery layouts
    * install a contact up form with EmailJS, discussed in another repo.
